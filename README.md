# DNA_Nanomotif_ML_MD
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of DNA nanomotifs using machine learning (ML) for parameter optimisation

DNA nanomotifs are a flexible, DNA-based platform that can be used to study the emerging behaviour of patchy particles. Applications include basic biophysical research, biomimetic approaches, compartmentalisation of reactions and information processing. Coarse grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations allow to study assembly, behaviour and response of dynamic networks of nanomotifs. This repository contains code that automates parameter tuning of CG simulations by using machine learning. One example optimises a bead-spring model of X-shaped DNA nanomotifs implemented in ReaDDy, by comparing angle distributions to a ground truth provided by nucleotide level simulations using oxDNA. These bead-spring models allow to simulate phase separation or condensation of nanomotifs on DNA strands with complementary target sites.
